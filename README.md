# Hp Download Recovery Media
 
 
Since upgrading to Windows 10, on my Alienware 17R3, I Constantly keep getting a popup to "update Your Recovery Media". I did update my recovery media immediately after upgrading to windows 10, But I still keep getting the popup every time i reboot my laptop and almost every hour or so. I have clicked on "Do Not remind me" option on popup , but I Still Get it!
 
I figured it no harm to trying to update my recovery media again just a couple days ago to see if I could get rid of the nagging popup, But I am still getting it. :emotion-18: Has anyone else experienced this and know any solution/suggestions??

I have the same problem and my operating system is Windows 8.1. This all started with the last Dell Backup & Restore software update. I called tech support but they won't look at the problem unless I pay since my system is out of warranty.
 
I have windows 8.1 and I also had an update for backup and restore software. Mine was popping up all the time asking question. I figured out how to get rid of it. First when installing or updating software there is a two step process. One is to update the software. Step two is to make a usb backup, if you don't do a new usb backup after the software update the pop up will drive you crazy. Even though I already had a backup copy on a usb drive I went ahead and did another copy because your software was updated your software wants to do a backup with the new version of software that it just updated.
 
I'm using win10 on a dell laptop and having the same problem. I am not using the program because I"m using a Western Digital backup. When the popup comes up, it gives me three options: update media, remind me later or do not remind me. I have clicked the "Do not remind me" a few dozen times and it still keeps coming back at regular intervals. I want to know how to stop it from coming back. Do I need to uninstall the program?
 
Sorry, It's been a long time now since I had this problem , but as previous user (dncingfool) said I believe it had something to do with choosing the backup option after clicking on the popup. You can use External Hard drive, DVD's or USB I believe.

Uninstall it. Solved my problem. Backup your data manually to an external media source. Download an installer for Dell Command Update and if you need to re-install windows you can use Command Update to download a full list of drivers for your system devices. You may need to manually install a network driver first if you're using a clean install of windows though.
 
I had this same problem on a Dell Precision 4800 with Windows 10; regardless of which option I checked, it popped up and interrupted my work every hour. I finally fixed it by going to "Add or Remove Programs" and uninstalling "Dell Backup and Recovery".
 
You can try following this but another option which might work is to use the media creator to do an ISO file then burn that to a USB after with a tool like Rufus. I always use ISO and then burn it myself to USB for boot as it could be an issue with UEFI vs BIOS boot in your system as well so this utility allows you to create the proper one and burn the ISO image.
 
Of course, they can be closed. Free, community and NFR licenses gets only support on best effort. If our support engineers have free capacity, they take on the free cases. 
But if the support load is high, then free cases will be closed after some days.
 
It would help, if you can describe all steps taken (probably with screenshots). Or take a video from the boot process until the cmd window shows up and upload it to youtube so we can see whats happening exactly.
 
While I'm not 100% certain exactly what happened during setup something went awry. She doesn't appear to have access to the MS account associated with the machine...when trying to do a recovery it says the account in question isn't an MS account.
 
None of that really matters, she had no data on the device so she wanted to just do a factory reset. However, because bitlocker was enabled we need the bitlocker key to do recovery via the recovery option envoked during boot.
 
You can use the HP cloud recovery tool on your PC or with another PC running W7 64 bit or newer and a 32 GB USB flash drive to create a bootable USB recovery drive that will reinstall W10, the drivers and the software that originally came with your PC.
 
I have just recently got a HP Pavilion dv6-1315tx computer second hand. It comes with Windows 7 Home Premium pre-installed. The first thing I wanted to do was to create a recovery disk,but it seems as if the previous owner has already created a set. I am from Sri Lanka so I cannot order a Recovery Kit from HP. Their support page is confusing.
 
After doing a lot of research, I deleted files such as hpdrcu.dat from the recovery partition as well as another location. I also searched for Rebecca.dat but to no avail on my whole system, but still it gives the same error.
 
I've created an ISO image using the recovery media creator tool, latest version available downloaded from ESET website. The image is for EEES Managed.
When booting from it, after about 30 seconds, the recovery environment fails with blue screen and error 0xc000a004 regarding ntoskrnls.exe. I've attached a screenshot to this thread.
 
I have also tried creating a USB flash drive instead of the ISO image. Also tried it on multiple machines, downloading the tool separately on each one. Even tried on a machine without antivirus software installed, as I found an older post here where the file above was marked as a false positive. Both ISO and direct USB flash drive fail to boot on multiple machines (Legacy & UEFI), and in virtual machines.
When building ISO image, the size of it is different each time a new one is created, by around 10-15 MB, which is very strange considering I am using the exact same options to create it and the exact same tool downloaded from ESET website.
 
If that is the case, if you disable 'Secure Boot' on the machines you are attempting to decrypt and create the ESET Recovery USB via the Creator Tool as a 'EFI USB 32 & 64 bit' instead of using the WIN RE methods. Does this allow you to boot to the USB and decrypt as expected?
 
This was part of a data recovery job. The laptop the NVMe drive came from had been damaged. The drive also had some issues. We were able to fully image it, and we needed to decrypt the image so that we could extract the data for our customer, who use ESET encryption in their company.
 
I did manage to decrypt the image using the EFI USB 32 & 64 bit, but after a few tries. The GUI version failed to load when the image drive was connected to the machine, and the text mode version failed to decrypt the drive midway. Tried it on 2 different machines, both with Gigabyte motherboards, BIOS reset to default settings. In the end I tried it on a computer with an ASUS motherboard, which worked using GUI version but only in performance mode.
 
We rarely deal with ESET encryption, as most of our customers prefer to use other solutions. However I will say that getting to the point where this drive was decrypted, was a process a lot longer than it had to be, and with so many issues with the recovery environment. It's unnecessary difficult just to get the process going.
 
Thank you for letting us know. Looking into this with the Development Team, this looks to be an issue with the Windows Recovery Environment which we utilize using our WIN RE option of the ESET Recovery USB to help allow customers using Legacy BIOS Mode machines 'Decrypt' their Workstations as well as providing another option to UEFI BIOS Mode machines.
 
I will continue looking into this with the team, but it seems like an issue that Microsoft are hopefully going to resolve and it is unfortunate our ESET Recovery USB WIN RE tool can be affected by this.
 
Carbonite Safe Server Backup requires you to create recovery media in order to perform a Bare Metal restore. It is recommended that you create the recovery media after you schedule your first Bare Metal Image backup.
 
The Create Recovery Media button is found within the Notifications panel of the Dashboard. Click this button to begin creation of your recovery media. It can also be found at the top of the Restore page.
 
The Microsoft ADK and accompanying PE add-on must be installed on the system in order to create the recovery media. Please download the Microsoft ADK and PE add-on here: -us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install.
 
These allow for the easiest recovery media creation process. However, the **Deployment Tools** and the **Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE)** are the only features that are required on most systems.
 
Your next step is to select the type of recovery media you wish to build. Your choices are **Removable flash media** which will look for a USB connected device to use as the boot media, **ISO Image** which will create an ISO to boot from. We recommend that you use a USB Flash Drive in order to make the Recovery Media. Make your selection and click **Next**.
 
Adding drivers into the recovery media is the next step. Drivers are useful if you have specific hardware installed that needs drivers before they will work. If you require specific drivers to be installed, click **Add storage device drivers** or **Add network device drivers** and you will be able to browse to where the drivers are so they can be included in the recovery media. Once you have added all the drivers you need, if necessary, click **Next**.
 
After you have added any drivers to your recovery media, you are prompted to select your network connection. By default this is automatically set up after you have successfully performed a Bare Metal Restore and restarted the machine. However, if your computer requires specific network settings, you can make those selections or manually configure the settings after you first start it up. We recommend, unless a specific IP address is required, that you connect automatically and obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. Once you have completed your selections, click **Next**.
